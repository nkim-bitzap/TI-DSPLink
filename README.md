# TI-OMAP3-DSPLink
# Port of the original TI DSPLink to the kernel 4.19.127 for BeagleBoard C4

This project deals with porting of the original TI DSPLink kernel module to
work with more recent Linux kernels (4.19 in my case) in order to utilize
the OMAP3 DSP on a BeagleBoard C4 for compiler development experiments
